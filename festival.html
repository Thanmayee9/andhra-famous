                        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Sankranthi in West Godavari</h2>
                        <h3>Vibrant Traditional Celebrations:</h3>Sankranthi is celebrated with great enthusiasm across West Godavari, beginning with Bhogi, where people light bonfires to discard old items and welcome new beginnings. The festival brings together families and communities for feasts, temple visits, and special rituals, including the Goda Devi Kalyanam performed at local temples.

                         <h3>Cultural Activities and Competitions:</h3>
                         The district is known for lively cultural programs during Sankranthi, such as singing, dancing, and traditional games like kabaddi. Women participate in rangoli (muggulu) competitions, creating intricate patterns in front of their homes. These activities foster community spirit and showcase the regionâ€™s rich heritage.

                         <h3>Cockfights and Local Festivities:</h3>
                         A unique and controversial aspect of Sankranthi in West Godavari is the organization of cockfights, which attract large crowds and significant betting. Despite legal restrictions, these events are a major draw, with elaborate arrangements and associated festivities, including food stalls and gambling, especially in areas like Bhimavaram.

                        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Mahashivaratri and Ratham Yathra at Sivadevuni Chikkala, West Godavari</h2>

                        <h3>Unique Mahashivaratri Rituals:</h3>
                         Mahashivaratri is celebrated with deep devotion at Sivadevuni Chikkala Temple, drawing thousands of devotees from across Andhra Pradesh. A distinctive tradition here involves childless couples planting coconut saplings in the temple premises on this auspicious day, praying for progeny. This ritual has made the temple particularly famous among families seeking blessings for children.

                         <h3>Ratham Yathra (Chariot Procession):</h3>
                         During Mahashivaratri, a grand Ratham Yathra (chariot procession) is organized. The templeâ€™s deity, Lord Shiva, is taken out in a beautifully decorated wooden chariot (ratham) around the village. Devotees enthusiastically participate by pulling the chariot, singing devotional songs, and making offerings, creating a vibrant and spiritual atmosphere in the village.

                         <h3>Community Gatherings and Festive Spirit:  </h3>
                         The festival transforms Sivadevuni Chikkala into a hub of cultural and spiritual activity. Besides the main rituals, the temple hosts special pujas, night-long prayers, and cultural programs. The entire community comes together, with food stalls, traditional music, and dance, making Mahashivaratri and the Ratham Yathra a major annual highlight for the region.

                        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Antharvedi Radha Yathra</h2>
                        <h3>Grand Chariot Procession (Rath Yatra):</h3>
                            The highlight of Antharvedi Radhayathra is the grand procession of Lord Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamyâ€™s idol on a newly built wooden chariot. Thousands of devotees gather to pull the chariot through the streets, accompanied by chanting, music, and dancing, creating a vibrant and devotional atmosphere.

                         <h3>Rituals and Special Pujas:</h3>

                         The festival begins with special pujas performed by temple priests and local dignitaries. The idols of the divine couple are first placed in a palanquin (pallaki) and then ceremoniously transferred to the chariot, amidst Vedic chants and traditional rituals. The event is often held on the auspicious day of Bhishma Ekadasi.

                         <h3>Community Participation and Sacred Bath:</h3>

                         Devotees from across the region participate enthusiastically, many taking a holy dip at the confluence of the Godavari River and the sea (Sangamam), which is believed to purify and grant blessings. The entire community joins in devotional singing, dancing, and pulling the chariot, making it a deeply spiritual and communal celebration.
